# Drag and drop shapes

1. We used GO JS. <https://gojs.net/>. This package helps in defining the canvas along with elements.
2. Along with the GOjs package, and Drag and drop API of HTML5. We implement this requirement.

## Steps

1. Define CSS for different shapes in the left area
2. Define Gojs shape for each of the possible shapes that can be in Canvas
3. We define what happens during each possible action during drag and drop. drag start, drag end, drag over, and drop. During drop we create actual shape and put it in the canvas.
