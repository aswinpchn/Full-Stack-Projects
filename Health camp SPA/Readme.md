# Healthcamp SPA

1. This project is to demonstrate knowledge over Web SQL and HTML.

2. So, we are having a registration page, where the user enters his details along with an image upload. This image is converted into Base64. All the data is then stored in an in browser WEB SQL storage.

3. In the reports page, we do select query from the databse, and display the results in a table format to the user. During retrieveal we get base64 string from the DB and give it as a src to image during display.

4. Technologies used are: HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, and Web SQL.
