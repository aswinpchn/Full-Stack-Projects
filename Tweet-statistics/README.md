This is a lab for working on basics of Aspect Oriented Programming.

What we are doing here is, when we follow/block/tweet. we collect all the data necessary and when user requests analytics/statistics, it will be ready for him.
All this happens in backend, after follow/block/tweet has executed.

Aspect Oriented programming is to remove cross cutting concerns from the actual code and do it seperately.

This is a maven project and works on Java6.
