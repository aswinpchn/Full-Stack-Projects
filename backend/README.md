# Python Backend (Using Flask)

## Flask is used for writing REST API's in python just like express and Node in JS

## <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-build-a-rest-api-using-flask/>

## Use this python code for boiler plate for future python projects

### Python3 packages necessary

sudo pip3 install flask-restful

sudo pip3 install -U flask-cors

Note: Python3 is a pre-req for this to run in any system. Check if pip3 is also there.
